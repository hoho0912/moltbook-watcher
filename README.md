## Overview

Moltbook is a social network where only AI agents can post, comment, and vote. Humans can only observe. This tool provides:

1. **Monitor** — Continuously track Moltbook feeds
2. **Classify** — Categorize posts by topic, sentiment, and significance
3. **Curate** — Select discussions relevant to human-AI relations with spam filtering
4. **Report** — Generate bilingual digests (English/Korean) with hybrid format (Fresh + Trending)
5. **Track Agents** — Dynamic reputation system with agent profiles page
6. **Analyze Comments** — Collect, rank, and feature top comments with diversity filtering

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run demo (with sample data)
npm run test

# Check API status
npx tsx src/cli.ts status

# Generate digest
npx tsx src/cli.ts digest      # English
npx tsx src/cli.ts digest ko   # Korean
```

## API Key Setup

To use the Moltbook API, you need to register as an agent:

1. Visit https://moltbook.com/skill.md
2. Register your agent and obtain API key
3. Set environment variable:

```bash
export MOLTBOOK_API_KEY=moltbook_xxx
```

Or create a `.env` file:

```
MOLTBOOK_API_KEY=moltbook_xxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx  # Optional: for Korean translation
```

## Features

### 🤖 Automated Pipeline

```
Collect → Classify → Filter Spam → Curate → Track Reputation → Report → Publish
```

- **Data Collection**: Hot, new, top, rising feeds from Moltbook
- **Smart Classification**: Heuristic-based topic and significance detection
- **Spam Filtering**: Regex-based spam detection with 0% false positive rate
- **Intelligent Curation**: Multi-factor scoring system (engagement, recency, topic relevance, trust bonus)
- **Hybrid Digest**: Fresh posts (24h) + Trending posts (popular but older)
- **Reputation Tracking**: Auto-learning trust scores for agents (+1 per digest, -5 per spam)
- **Agent Profiles**: Public-facing page showing agent rankings and post history
- **Weekly Reports**: Automated weekly aggregation with topic trends, agent activity, and top posts
- **Bilingual Output**: AI-powered Korean translation using Claude Haiku (~$0.06/month)
- **Static Website**: Clean, responsive design hosted on GitHub Pages

### 🛡️ Spam Filtering & Quality Control

**Precision Spam Detection**:
- Word-boundary regex patterns (e.g., `/\bpump\.fun\b/i`, `/\btoken\s+launch/i`)
- 0% false positive rate (tested on 50+ posts)
- Automatic blocklist management with spam post tracking

**Quality Filters**:
- Emoji-only posts filtered out
- Posts < 5 characters excluded
- Low-effort content detection

### ⭐ Dynamic Reputation System

**Trust Score Algorithm**:
```
Starting Score: 5 points
Digest Appearance: +1 per unique post featured
Spam Block: -5 per unique spam post
Trust Bonus: trustScore × 2 (applied to curation ranking)
```

**Anti-Inflation Safeguards**:
- Duplicate post detection by post ID
- Same post appearing in multiple digests only counted once
- Trending posts don't inflate scores
- English digest only updates scores (Korean is translation)

**Agent Profiles Page** (`/agents.html`):
- Ranked list of trusted agents by trust score
- Up to 5 most recent featured posts per agent
- Featured comments section showing top contributions
- Blocked accounts section with spam evidence
- Automatic updates with each digest

### 💬 Comment Reputation System

**Comment Collection**:
- Uses Moltbook public web API (`/api/v1/posts/{id}`)
- Collects all comments per featured post
- Spam filtering applied (same patterns as posts)

**Comment Trust Score Algorithm**:
```
Featured Comment: +0.5 per unique comment
Spam Comment: -2.5 per unique spam comment
Total Score: 5 + (posts × 1) + (comments × 0.5) - (postSpam × 5) - (commentSpam × 2.5)
```

**Diversity Filtering** (Two-Pass Algorithm):
- **Pass 1**: Guarantee 1 comment per post (respecting max 2 per agent)
- **Pass 2**: Fill remaining slots (max 3 per post, max 2 per agent globally)
- **Selection**: Pure upvotes-based ranking (no trust score weighting)

**Featured Comments Display**:
- Up to 3 comments per post in digest
- All posts guaranteed to have comments
- Fair distribution across agents
- Bilingual translation support

### 📰 Hybrid Digest Format

**Fresh Posts** (🆕):
- Posted within last 24 hours
- Emphasis on recency bonus
- Showcases newest agent activity

**Trending Posts** (🔥):
- Older but highly engaged posts
- Emphasis on engagement bonus
- Surface important discussions that remain relevant

**Selection Logic**:
- 50/50 split between Fresh and Trending
- Prevents stale digests when activity is low
- Ensures mix of new and proven content

## Usage

### Programmatic Use

```typescript
import {
  createCollector,
  generateDailyDigest,
  formatDigestMarkdown
} from './src/index.js';

// Create collector
const collector = createCollector(process.env.MOLTBOOK_API_KEY);

// Fetch hot posts
const feed = await collector.getHotPosts(25);

// Generate digest
const digest = await generateDailyDigest(entries, 'en');
const markdown = formatDigestMarkdown(digest);
```

### CLI Use

```bash
# Collect posts
npx tsx src/cli.ts collect

# Generate digest
npx tsx src/cli.ts digest ko

# Process daily pipeline
npm run process-daily       # English
